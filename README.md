# Project-Euler-Free-Pascal

These are my solutons for project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/about) using Free Pascal. Some of the programs use the GMP library for large numbers, I am not sure if it is still available on windows. 
I included a bash file to format all the source files with the ptop utility using the also included ptop.cfg file  

Euler.pp has some functions/procedures that are used by different programs.
